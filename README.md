# Color-Recognition-Game

by Russell Koo and Kegan Lim

Objective: The primary goal of this project was to develop an interactive colour recognition game targeted at elderly individuals and children. The game is designed to be both entertaining and educational, helping users improve their colour recognition skills.

Technology Used: The game was built using a Raspberry Pi, which served as the central processing unit. A Raspberry Pi LCD screen was used for display purposes, providing a user-friendly interface for players to interact with the game.

Game Mechanics: The game utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence and distance of the player’s hand. This allows for a touchless interaction, making the game more accessible and hygienic. A motor is used to spin a counter located at the top right of the game interface, providing a visual representation of the player’s score or progress.

Interaction: Touch sensors were also incorporated into the design, offering an alternative mode of interaction. Players can choose to use either the ultrasonic sensors or the touch sensors based on their preference or comfort.

Target Audience: This game is suitable for both elderly individuals who want to keep their minds active and children who are learning about colours. The simple yet engaging gameplay makes it an excellent tool for cognitive stimulation and learning.
